# CDE_Web_Scrape
This is a project that allows CA educators to extract data from the CA Department of Enducation website. This allows users to pull multiple years of data for any puclic school in the state of CA for analysis.

## Requirements
This will run best on a Linux Virtual Machine or any machine that you can run Docker Containers. I am including a script to install Docker on linux, but I suggest that you refer to https://www.docker.com/ for the best installation on your machine.
